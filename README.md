# Python-Learning
# Python Overview

Python is a

- general purpose programming language  
- interpreted, not compiled  
- both dynamically typed and strongly typed  
- supports multiple programming paradigms: object oriented, functional  
- comes in 2 main versions in use today: 2.7 and 3.x  

## Python's Interactive Console: The Interpreter

The Python interpreter is a console that allows interactive development. We are currently using the Jupyter notebook, which uses an advanced Python interpreter called IPython. This gives us much more power and flexibility.

# üìò Python Strings:

Strings are used in Python to represent **textual data**‚Äîsuch as names, sentences, or any sequence of characters. A string in Python is a **sequence**, meaning Python keeps track of each element by its position (index).

For example, the word "Python" is understood by Python as a sequence of characters in a specific order. This allows operations like indexing to access specific characters (such as the first or last letter).

## 1. ‚úÖ Creating Strings

Strings can be created using **single quotes** or **double quotes**. This allows flexibility and supports the inclusion of quotation marks inside strings without confusion.

---

## 2. üì• Variables Store Values

Variables can be used to store strings, which helps in writing cleaner, more efficient, and reusable code. Instead of typing the same string repeatedly, you can assign it to a variable and refer to that variable.

---

## 3. üî¢ String Indexing

Strings are sequences, so their elements can be accessed by index numbers. Indexing starts from **0**. You can retrieve characters from specific positions in a string using these indices.

---

## 4. ‚ûï String Concatenation & ‚úñÔ∏è Repetition

**String concatenation** is the process of combining two or more strings into one.  
**String repetition** is the process of repeating a string multiple times.

These operations allow you to construct and manipulate strings dynamically.

---

## 5. üîç String Slicing and Indexing

**String indexing** is used to access a single character by its position.  
**String slicing** extracts a portion of a string by specifying a range of indices.

Slicing includes the start index but excludes the end index, which is a common pattern in Python. Negative indices can also be used to count from the end of the string.

## 6. üß∞ Built-in String Methods

Python strings come with built-in methods that allow common operations like converting to uppercase or lowercase. These methods are called using dot notation and can enhance the flexibility of string manipulation.

---

## 7. üñ®Ô∏è Print Formatting

Python supports multiple ways to embed variables inside strings for formatted output:

- Using placeholders with the `%` operator  
- Using the `.format()` method  
- Using **f-strings** (formatted string literals), which are concise and readable

These formatting tools make it easy to combine text with dynamic values for display or logging.

---

## üßæ Summary

- Strings are sequences of characters.
- They support indexing, slicing, concatenation, and repetition.
- Built-in methods allow manipulation like case conversion.
- Print formatting offers various ways to insert variables into strings.
